## 🧠 About Me

I'm a **hands-on architect and product strategist** passionate about building **intelligent, scalable, and modular systems**.  
With deep expertise across **Spring Boot, Node.js, and AI-based architectures**, I bridge the gap between **product vision and engineering execution**.

I love designing systems that are:
- ⚙️ **Robust and maintainable** — crafted with clean architecture
- 🤝 **Composable and scalable** — designed for distributed teams and services
- 🧩 **Smart and adaptive** — powered by automation, ML, and modern DevOps
- 🔭 ***12+ year of experience*** working with all sort of clients & technologies.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on enhancing my skills in Kubernetes and server management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about cloud-native architectures and microservices.
- 💬 Ask me about software architecture, CI/CD pipelines, or anything related to Node.js and React.

## 💡 My Engineering Philosophy

> “Build systems that are **simple at the surface, powerful at the core, and scalable for the future.**”

- 🧩 Architecture First → clarity before code  
- ⚡ Automate Everything → efficiency through scripting and workflows  
- 🤖 AI by Design → integrate intelligence at every level of the stack  
- 🧠 Learn Relentlessly → always exploring emerging tech like LLMs, Rust, and privacy-first AI  

---

## 🛠️ Current Interests

- 🦀 Learning **Rust** for system-level performance and AI inference  
- 🧠 Exploring **local LLMs (Ollama)** and **open-weight VLMs (SmolVLM, Mistral, Phi-3)**  
- 🔍 Building privacy-preserving, explainable AI architectures  
- 🔔 Workflow-based automation using Camunda or Flowable embedded in Spring Boot
